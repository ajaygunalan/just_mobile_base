# A creo cad model is converted into a urdf and tested here.

## Important Notes

1. Make sure that stl files are binary and not ASCII.
2. Make sure that the location of stl files are correct and are properly specificed like [here](https://github.com/ajaygunalan/just_mobile_base/blob/master/advr_mob_plt_description/urdf/main.urdf).
3. Make sure to have **MatLab Version** less than **2016** and generate **first generation XML files**
4. Check the URDF by: `check_urdf <urdf file>` to get something like this:
```
robot name is: MAIN
---------- Successfully Parsed XML ---------------
root Link: CHASSIS_SUB has 4 child(ren)
    child(1):  WHEEL_SUB
    child(2):  WHEEL_SUB-1
    child(3):  WHEEL_SUB-2
    child(4):  WHEEL_SUB-3
```
or use `urdf_to_graphiz <urdf file>` for pdf containing the tree structure like [this](https://github.com/ajaygunalan/just_mobile_base/blob/master/advr_mob_plt_description/urdf/MAIN.pdf).
